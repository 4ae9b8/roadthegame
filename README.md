## ToDo

* Gulp to create endresult [Tim]
* Make sounds [Tim]
* Achievements [Tim]


## The Game (& ideas)

* You control a minion -- **Done**
* You run from left to right and right to left -- **Done**
* In the middle of the canvas is a road -- **Done**
* On the road are different type of cars (size and color and shit) -- **Done**
* If you get hit by a car you are dead -- **Done**
* If you consume power up, you get special abbilities (more minions at the same time, bonus points for a limited time) - **Done**?
* Goals of the game: Die fast, as much as possible
* You earn scores for every shit you do (hit special cars, die fast (like a mupliplicator or something))
* Stupid sounds like MMOOOOONSTER KILL from Quake3
* Add a trail for power up *speed* - **Done**
* Get crowded on power up *minion* - **Done**
* Achievements
* Cars getting faster the longer you play - **Done**
* Multiplier for each minion you have - **Done**
* Intro screen with basic howto
* Favicon
* A "storm"/lot of cars after x minutes (random), but with a x second countdown so that the player will see that he is dying soon
* Death-Counter - **Done**
* Show current game difficulty (based on how fast the cars are)
* Motor cycles in between the cars (on every side) with half the width of a car and a max height
* Random bombs, hurricanes, Tsunami -> Connected to the "Storm"-Countdown so that a random SHIT FUCK will happen to the player
* Power-ups spawn if you get one point (or if you reached the other side + every minion [maybe]) - **Done**
* Make cars wobble from side to side  - **Done**
* Cooldown "display" for power-ups
* Use requestAnimationFrame so that the game pauses if the window is not active - **Done**?
* Spawn more power ups the faster the cars get


## Bugs

* Doesn't work on SF on ubuntu
* Minions don't die after being run over
* Cars are overlapping
* ~~Power up *bomb* destroys all other power ups (Even the the ones to come)~~
* ~~If you have x minions and move from one lane to the other you just get 1 score instead of 1 + x~~
