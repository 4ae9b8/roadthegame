Road The Game
===

Why did the chicken cross the road?


## ToDo

* Create the game [Mads|Tim]
* ~~Gulp to create endresult [Tim]~~
* Make sounds [Tim]
* Achievements [Mads|Tim]
* Rewrite to use rAF [Mads|Tim]


## The Game (& ideas)

* ~~You control a minion~~
* ~~You run from left to right and right to left~~
* ~~In the middle of the canvas is a road~~
* ~~On the road are different type of cars (size and color and shit)~~
* ~~If you get hit by a car you are dead~~
* ~~If you consume power up, you get special abbilities (more minions at the same time, bonus points for a limited time)~~
* Goals of the game: Die fast, as much as possible
* You earn scores for every shit you do (hit special cars, die fast (like a mupliplicator or something))
* Stupid sounds like MMOOOOONSTER KILL from Quake3
* ~~Add a trail for power up *speed*~~
* ~~Get crowded on power up *minion*~~
* Achievements
* ~~Cars getting faster the longer you play~~
* ~~Multiplier for each minion you have~~
* Intro screen with basic howto
* Favicon
* A "storm"/lot of cars after x minutes (random), but with a x second countdown so that the player will see that he is dying soon
* ~~Death-Counter~~
* Show current game difficulty (based on how fast the cars are)
* Motor cycles in between the cars (on every side) with half the width of a car and a max height
* Random bombs, hurricanes, Tsunami -> Connected to the "Storm"-Countdown so that a random SHIT FUCK will happen to the player
* ~~Power-ups spawn if you get one point (or if you reached the other side + every minion [maybe])~~
* ~~Make cars wobble from side to side~~
* Cooldown "display" for power-ups
* Use requestAnimationFrame so that the game pauses if the window is not active
* Spawn more power ups the faster the cars get
* Make the game scalable


## Bugs

* Doesn't work in SF on ubuntu
* Minions don't die after being run over
* Cars are overlapping
* ~~Power up *bomb* destroys all other power ups (Even the the ones to come)~~
* ~~If you have x minions and move from one lane to the other you just get 1 score instead of 1 + x~~
* Minions overlap (after x + 1 minion power-ups you don't see the other minions anymore) -> Maybe only when you have the invincible power up
